Today is my last day at Google after six years.

## Some history

I joined Google back in 2015. At the time, I'd been working at a little consulting start-up (where I was employee #70) in my hometown of Atlanta. I was seriously feeling the itch to move on to bigger, better things. I especially wanted to spend more time on open source and Python. I also really, really wanted to find new mentors and role models. I felt like I had stagnated. So when I finally got the chance to uproot my life and move to Seattle to work for Google I took it. No questions asked.

I started on the Google Cloud Platform developer relations team. This was my dream job - I got to do *more* than just writing code. I got to talk to really talented people, try out new, exciting things, engage in communities, and even work on open source. I got to work with and become friends with some of the most incredible people. During those first two years it was kind of like a dream. Cloud was still small (y'know, before Kubernetes took off) and it was possible to feel like you had a good grasp of the technology and the people behind it.

I learned so much during that time. So much about technology, so much about writing & speaking, so much about the soft, squishy human element, and so much about myself. It was also a turning point for me financially- I had never in my life experienced any sort of financial security until I started at Google. I am thankful, lucky, and privileged to have been able to have those experiences.

But the nature of life is change. Cloud eventually became **huge**. I ended up establishing an entire team within developer relations to manage all of Google's API client libraries. I put myself out in the Python community and took on all kinds of things from [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), to [packaging.python.org](https://packaging.python.org), to organizing [PyCascades](https://pycascades.com). I tried to do all of this while simultaneously dealing with my gender transition. I burned out **hard**.

## A new team

When I returned from my short mental health leave I decided to switch over to the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) developer relations team. There were several people there that I was really excited to work with and I was eager to be a smaller team again.

My first few months were great, but as key members of the team left and things in the world started to get more complicated I became more and more distressed. Living alone in Seattle was literally killing me. Engaging at work became impossible.

I eventually had to take a leave of absence to deal with my own personal mental health. I returned from that leave too early and I ended up having to pack up and move back home to Atlanta and take another leave to start making any positive progress on my mental health.

Thankfully, that was a turning point for me. My mental health has improved so much and being with family provides me with a much needed emotional support system. When I returned to work I was ready.

Unfortunately things didn't work out. For a combination of factors - my new, rookie manager, the fact that I couldn't find a new team, the issues with performance reviews during my leave, and the feeling that Google's actions had long been at odds with my personal values - I decided to resign.

My mental health is more important to me than a "dream" job. When faced with the decision of contining to place myself in situations that would clearly compromise my mental health & psychological safety or leaving, I left.


## Leaving tech

I'm not just leaving Google, I'm taking a big step away from Tech. At this time I don't have any desire to be employed by another tech giant and I certainly don't want anything to do with venture-funded startups. The tech industry has turned cold to me. In the past five years I've seen others (and myself) become more and more distant and detached from the *human* element of technology. So much of what I see these days is tech for the sake of profit, or tech just for the sake of tech. I miss seeing tech that was empowering, enabling, and human-centered.

I am taking a long, indefinite break from "Tech", and I may not return.


## What's next?

I don't completely know. I've never, ever in my life had the opportunity to sit down and actually consider what I *really* want to do. I was in survival mode for so much of my life.

I'm going to give myself the rest of the year to rest, reset, and recover. I'm going to focus on [Winterbloom](https://winterbloom.com) for a while. It's something that really feels like a meaningful creative expression and I want to persue that.

Along the way, I'm still going to write [wild articles about synthesizers](/the-design-of-the-juno-dco/) and [excessively explain low-level nonsense](/the-most-thoroughly-commented-linker-script/). I'm going to play a lot of music. I'm going to be considering ways that I can interact with the communities that I believe are making a positive impact in the world.

My mission still remains the same- to empower people through technology.

Once next year arrives I'll start figuring out long-term plans. It might be switching to a career in education, it might be doing more with Winterbloom, it might be working for non-profits.

I hope y'all with follow along. For the first time in a long time I'm excited about the possibilities.
